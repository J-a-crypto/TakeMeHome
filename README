Welcome to my idea of a gift. I am making this to impress my girlfriend and overwhelm her with cuteness. This can be my way of going back into making projects too.

My girlfriend throughout the years I've known her has made it apparent how badly she wants pets but obviously I can't grant her wishes due to the reality of it BUT why not just give her these pets on her phone. She can take care of them and name them and show them the type of love she shows to me daily. 

I am using React to create this project and will try my best to get this done by her birthday (7 days). 

BET ITS ON!!!
